What are the different data types present in C++?,"The 4 data types in C++ are given below:

Primitive Datatype(basic datatype). Example- char, short, int, float, long, double, bool,
Derived datatype. Example- array, pointer
Enumeration. Example- enum
User-defined data types. Example- structure, class"
What are class and object in C++?,"A class is a user-defined data type that has data members and member functions. Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions that are used to perform operations on these variables.

An object is an instance of a class. Since a class is a user-defined data type so an object can also be called a variable of that data type."
What is operator overloading?,"Operator Overloading is a very essential element to perform the operations on user-defined data types. By operator overloading we can modify the default meaning to the operators like +, -, *, /, <=, etc. "
What is a constructor in C++?,The constructor is a member function that is executed automatically whenever an object is created. Constructors have the same name as the class of which they are members so that compiler knows that the member function is a constructor. And no return type is used for constructors.

What is black-box testing?,"It is a testing strategy based solely on requirements and specifications. In this strategy, it requires no knowledge of internal paths, structures, or implementation of the software being tested."
What is white-box testing?,"It is a testing strategy based on internal paths, code structures, and implementation of the software being tested. White box testing generally requires detailed programming skills."
What is gray-box tetsing?,It is a strategy for software debugging in which the tester has limited knowledge of the internal details of the program.
What is unit testing?,"A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property. The isolated part of the definition is important."
